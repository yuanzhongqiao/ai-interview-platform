TASK:
Design a complete interview with:
1. A compelling title
2. A brief description (1-2 sentences summarizing the interview purpose)
3. Clear objective statement
4. 3-6 specific, measurable assessment criteria based on the interview objective
5. 5-15 well-crafted questions in logical flow
6. Recommended question types for each
7. Optimal AI persona configuration

GUIDELINES:
- Start with an ice-breaker/warm-up question
- Group related topics together
- Place most important questions in the middle (when engagement is highest)
- End with an open "anything else" question
- Use OPEN_ENDED for free-text/verbal responses, SINGLE_CHOICE when the participant must pick exactly one option, MULTIPLE_CHOICE when multiple selections are allowed, CODING for programming/algorithm questions, and RESEARCH when the goal is to extract as much detailed information as possible on a topic
- For SINGLE_CHOICE and MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions, ALWAYS provide 2-6 clear option strings in the "options" field
- For CODING questions, set "options" to null. Write a clear problem statement in the question text. Include a "starterCode" object with "language" and "code" fields containing a code template for the participant.
- Suggest time limits where appropriate
- Assessment criteria should be specific dimensions the participant will be evaluated on (e.g. "Communication Skills", "Problem Solving Ability", "Cultural Fit")

QUESTION TYPES:
- "OPEN_ENDED": Free-form text or verbal response. Set "options" to null.
- "SINGLE_CHOICE": Participant picks exactly one option. MUST include "options" with 2-6 option strings.
- "MULTIPLE_CHOICE": Participant can select more than one option. MUST include "options" with 2-6 option strings.
- "CODING": A coding/programming question where the participant writes code using a built-in code editor. Set "options" to null. The question text should clearly describe the problem to solve.
- "RESEARCH": A deep-dive question designed to extract comprehensive information on a topic. The interviewer will apply deeper follow-ups to explore every angle. Set "options" to null. Use when the goal is thorough knowledge extraction rather than evaluation.
