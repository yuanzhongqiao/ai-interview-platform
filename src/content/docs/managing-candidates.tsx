        <h2>Adding Candidates</h2>
        <p>

          </DocStep>
          <DocStep step={2} title="Import by Excel">
            <p>Download the template, fill in session details, and upload the file. Name is required for each row.</p>

        <h2>Link Types</h2>
        <DocFeatureGrid>
          <DocFeature title="Public Link">
            Anyone with the URL can start a session. Use for job postings or broad distribution. Enable this on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab under <strong>Shareable Link</strong>.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="Invite-Only Link">
            Each candidate gets a unique link tied to their email. Best when you need to control exactly who participates. Copy each link from the Sessions tab.
          </DocFeature>
        </DocFeatureGrid>

        <hr />

        <h2>Session States</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not Started</strong> — the candidate has not opened the link yet</li>
          <li><strong>In Progress</strong> — the candidate is actively taking the interview</li>
          <li><strong>Completed</strong> — the session is finished and AI analysis is available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Filter the Sessions tab by status to focus on active or completed sessions.
        </p>

        <h2>Resuming and Retaking</h2>
        <p>
          If a candidate leaves before finishing, they can return to the same link and continue where they left off. To start a completely new session (e.g., after technical issues), use the <strong>Retake</strong> option — the previous session is kept for comparison.
        </p>

        <DocCallout variant="info">
          Each retake creates an independent session with its own transcript and scores.
