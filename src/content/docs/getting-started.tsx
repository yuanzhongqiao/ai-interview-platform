        <h2>Product Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Aural is an AI-powered interview platform that conducts structured interviews autonomously. You design an interview, share a link, and Aural&apos;s AI handles the conversation — asking questions, probing with follow-ups, and generating detailed analysis when the session is complete.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <DocFeatureGrid>
          <DocFeature title="AI Interviewer">
            An AI agent conducts the interview in real time — asking questions, listening to responses, and following up intelligently based on what the candidate says.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="Multiple Channels">
            Run interviews via voice (speech-to-speech), text chat, or video. Candidates can even switch between voice and chat mid-session.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="Rich Question Types">
            Go beyond open-ended questions with single/multiple choice, live coding (Monaco editor), whiteboard drawing (Excalidraw), and research-depth probing.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="Automated Analysis">
            Every completed session produces AI-generated summaries, per-question scores, key highlights, and areas for improvement — no manual review required.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="AI Interview Generator">
            Describe your goals in plain language and the AI generates a full interview with questions, assessment criteria, and recommended settings.
          </DocFeature>
          <DocFeature title="Team Collaboration">
            Share interviews and results across your organization. Multiple team members can create interviews, review sessions, and export reports.
          </DocFeature>
        </DocFeatureGrid>
